# BTWaD-ThreeJS
Before There Was a Dam Project 3D model interactive viewer with information on how it works and how to add your own models to the layout.

## Three.js
The [Three.js project](https://threejs.org/) is a library written in JavaScript that allows developers to use 3D models in a webbrowser with many customizations. Detailed examples and documentation are located here and is the backbone of this project

## SketchUp and Obj files
This project used [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/) to texture the models. The Three.js part of this project uses .obj files instead of the standard .skp which comes from the SketchUp program. Thus, an [online converter](https://www.sketchup.com/) can be used to convert files from SketchUp into the required .obj file
