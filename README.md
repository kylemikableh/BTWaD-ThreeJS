# BTWaD-ThreeJS
Before There Was a Dam Project 3D model interactive viewer with information on how it works and how to add your own models to the layout.

# Resources
## Three.js
The [Three.js project](https://threejs.org/) is a library written in JavaScript that allows developers to use 3D models in a webbrowser with many customizations. Detailed examples and documentation are located here and is the backbone of this project

## SketchUp and Obj files
This project used [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/) to texture the models. The Three.js part of this project uses .obj files instead of the standard .skp which comes from the SketchUp program. Thus, an [online converter](https://www.sketchup.com/) can be used to convert files from SketchUp into the required .obj file

## HTML Basics
This project uses [PHP](https://www.php.net/) files instead of [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/) files, but does not use any PHP functions. Thus, for the front-end User Interface, simple HTML knowledge and [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css) knowledge for styling is required to edit and make new pages, but these can be found on [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp).

## JavaScript Basics
[JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) is a scripting language for web browsers that allows for many interactive features in the web browser.
